Project Structure
The hands on project on Transfer Learning for food classification is divided into following tasks:

Task 1: Understand the problem statement and business case

Task 2: Import libraries and datasets

Task 3: Data exploration and data visualization

Task 4: Perform data augmentation and create data generator

Task 5: Transfer Learning Intuition

Task 6: Build deep learning model using pre-trained InceptionResnetV2

Task 7: Compile and train deep learning model

Task 8: Fine tune the trained model

Task 9: Assess the performance of the trained model
